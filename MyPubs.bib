	abstract = {Grain refinement by inoculation relies upon particles which act as heterogeneous nucleation sites. A novel concept of grain refinement by isomorphic self-inoculation is introduced in this paper. The inoculant particles have the same crystallographic structure as the solidifying phase, and the nucleation stage is replaced by direct epitaxial growth compared to classical inoculation. This concept has been successfully applied to a Ti-Al alloy, where classical inoculants (borides, carbides) can be embrittling in the as-cast state. Casting trials were successful in reducing the as-cast grain size as well as increasing the equiaxed grain fraction. It is shown that, opposed to classical inoculation theory, the particle size distribution has no influence and only the number of inoculant particles introduced impacts the final grain size. Moreover, the results suggest that each introduced particle can be responsible for multiple grains found in the as-cast ingot.},

	abstract = {Relatively low levels of inter-pass deformation have been found to be very effective in refining the coarse columnar grain structures normally seen in Ti-6Al-4V components, built using wire-fed high-deposition-rate additive manufacturing processes. The most important process parameters that control the level of β recrystallization – the final grain size and micro-texture – were systematically investigated by simulating the deformation and high heating rate conditions in controlled samples, to develop the process knowledge required to optimise inter-pass deformation and obtain predictable grain sizes. Overall, it was found that the level of β-grain refinement achieved by inter-pass deformation was surprisingly insensitive to the ranges of deformation temperatures, deformation speeds, and changes to the as-deposited α + β microstructure, expected within the WAAM process window, provided a minimum plastic strain of only 14\% was achieved in each added layer. Conversely, the final component grain size was shown to be strongly affected by rapid grain growth on re-heating above the β transus. The texture results obtained were consistent with previous work which suggested that, with fine AM transformation microstructures, new β-grain orientations may be produced during the α → β transformation from the development of twinning faults, induced by the prior deformation and rapid heating. In contrast, greatly increasing the starting α lamellar spacing – to be more similar to that found in a wrought material – greatly reduced the level of recrystallization and also appeared to change the recrystallization mechanism to favour new β orientations produced largely by local lattice rotation.},

Three alloys, Ti-10Al-25Nb, Ti-25Al-10Ta, and Ti-47Ta (at \%) were selected as potential isomorphic inoculants for a Ti-46Al alloy. The binary Ti-Ta alloy selected was found to be ineffective as an inoculant due to its large density difference with the melt, causing the particles to settle. Both ternary alloys were successfully implemented as isomorphic inoculants that decreased the equiaxed grain size and increased the equiaxed fraction in their ingots. The degree of grain refinement obtained was found to be dependent on the number of particles introduced to the melt. Also, more new grains were formed than particles added to the melt. The grains/particle efficiency varied from greater than one to nearly twenty as the size of the particle increased. This is attributed to the breaking up of particles into smaller particles by dissolution in the melt. For a given particle size, Ti-Al-Ta and Ti-Al-Nb particles were found to have a roughly similar grain/particle efficiency.},

In order to reduce the size of the solidified β-grains, as well as refine their columnar morphology and randomise their texture, two cubic nitride phases, TiN and ZrN were investigated as potential grain refining inoculants. To avoid the cost of manufacturing new wire, experimental trials were performed using powder adhered to the surface of the deposited tracks. With TiN particle additions, the β grain size was successfully reduced and modified from columnar to equiaxed grains, with an average size of 300 µm, while ZrN powder was shown to be ineffective at low addition levels studied. Clusters of TiN particles were found to be responsible for nucleating multiple β Ti grains. By utilizing the Burgers orientation relationship, EBSD investigation showed that a Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship could be demonstrated between the refined primary β grains and TiN particles.},

	abstract = {The influence of three deposition strategies on the fatigue crack growth behaviour of Wire + Arc Additive Manufactured (WAAM) Ti–6Al–4V has been investigated in the as-built condition. Test samples were prepared using single pass, parallel pass, and oscillation deposition strategies and tested with cracks propagating parallel and normal to the plane of deposition. Due to the higher local heat input, the oscillation build exhibited a significantly coarser columnar β grain structure as well as a coarser transformation microstructure, compared to the single pass and parallel pass builds, which were very similar. Among the three build methods, the lowest crack growth rates were found with the oscillation build. The crack growth data was found to broadly fall between that of a recrystallized α (mill-annealed) and β annealed wrought material, with the oscillation strategy build behaving more similarly to a β annealed microstructure. The fatigue crack growth rate was lower when cracks were propagated perpendicular to the build layers. For each build strategy, a greater microstructural influence on crack growth rate was found at lower levels of stress intensity factor range ({\textless}25 MPa m1/2). However, the anisotropy and scatter in the data was much more significant in the case of the oscillation build. These differences have been attributed to the stronger α microtexture heterogeneity present in the oscillation build, which led to a greater crack deflection and bifurcation, giving rise to lower crack growth rates and a higher sensitivity to the anisotropy caused by the directional β grain structure.},

	abstract = {High-deposition-rate, directed-energy-deposition additive manufacturing (DED-AM) processes typically produce Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64) components with coarse columnar β-grain structures that lead to undesirable mechanical anisotropy, as well as a fine heterogeneous lamellar transformation microstructure, which is very different to that seen standard wrought products. This arises because of the intrinsic lack of constitutional undercooling at the solidification front, and the subsequent high cooling rates and rapid thermal cycling experienced by the deposited material. In this work, the more refined primary β-grain solidification structures and textures seen in components built with the novel coaxial electron beam wire DED AM (CEWAM) process have been characterised in detail, for the first time, with the aim of investigating the potential for this technology to directly replicate the β-annealed damage-tolerant microstructure used in large Ti64 aerospace forgings. Due to its different lower energy density solidification conditions, it has been confirmed, by electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis and β-grain reconstruction in three orthogonal cross-sections, that the CEWAM process changes the melt conditions to promote β-grain nucleation ahead of the solidification front, which can result in a highly refined, equiaxed, β-grain structure. However, the conditions for refinement were marginal and a mixed grain structure was commonly observed in thicker sections. Additionally, the subsequent grain-growth stability during β-annealing was investigated. It is shown that an equivalent microstructure can be achieved to that seen in a standard β-forged component, by grain structure homogenisation and slow cooling through the β transus, to promote α colony nucleation, allowing direct part substitution. This was made possible by the refined primary β-grain structure achieved during deposition with the CEWAM solidification conditions which, importantly, are also shown to lead to a weaker texture than in a typical forging.},

The mechanical anisotropy caused by this coarse primary grain structure cannot be eliminated by subsequent solid-state phase transformations. In order to attempt to refine the size of the solidified β-grains and reduce their strong texture, the growth restriction efficiency of low addition levels of the strongly partitioning element (k = 0.1) yttrium (Y) has been investigated. Less than 0.8 wt.\% Y was sufficient to reduce the widths of the solidified columnar β grains from 1 to 2 mm to 100–300 µm. Y was also found to induce a columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) in the latter stages of melt pool solidification, which benefits from a lower liquid thermal gradient and higher solidification velocity. Inter-dendritic segregation of Y was also found to be significant and oxygen scavenging led to the formation of Y2O3 particles in the inter-dendritic liquid, with a previously unreported irregular eutectic morphology. High-resolution EBSD analysis showed these particles exhibited specific orientation relationships with the solidified β grains, which were confirmed experimentally.},

First, microsegregation was characterized in samples manufactured by directional solidiﬁcation, and then by gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). The experimental results were compared with Thermo-Calc calculations to verify their accuracy. It was conﬁrmed that the thermodynamic database predicts most alloying elements well. Once this data had been determined, several tip undercooling calculations were carried out for different solidiﬁcation conditions in terms of ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal gradient values. These calculations allowed the authors to develop a parametrization card for the constants of the microsegregation model, according to the process parameters (e.g., convection in melt pool, thermal gradient, and growth velocity). A new model of microsegregation, including convection and tip undercooling, is also proposed. The Tong–Beckermann microsegregation model was used individually and coupled with a modiﬁed Kurz-Giovanola-Trivedi (KGT) tip undercooling model, in order to take into account the convection in the ﬂuid ﬂow at the dendrite tip. Model predictions were compared to experimental results and showed the microsegregation evolution accurately.},

	abstract = {Certain magnesium alloy systems can obtain superior mechanical strength through age hardening. However, conventional ageing heat treatments for these alloys are rarely more complex than a single isothermal hold –especially when compared to those of aluminium alloys – so age hardenable magnesium alloys may not be achieving their full strengthening potential. The use of preageing, where a lower temperature heat treatment is utilised before a hotter secondary ageing step, has proven successful in boosting the strength of magnesium alloys previously, but these trials are few in number, and the testing conditions are limited. In this work, a wide range of preageing temperatures and times were trialled on commercial and experimental magnesium alloys to determine the effectiveness of the strengthening technique. The results showed that preageing can produce a significant boost in hardness, can reduce total ageing times, and can provide a degree of mechanical property customisation through control of precipitate habit plane and morphology. However, the effectiveness of the technique is alloysystem dependent, where the fundamental precipitate nucleation and phase evolution is a key contributor to the success of preageing; as is the energy barrier to nucleation in an alloy system, whether that be controlled by alloy chemistry or thermomechanical processing. The results are discussed in the context of alloy design and industrial processing.},
