abstract: Relatively low levels of inter-pass deformation have been found to be very
  effective in refining the coarse columnar grain structures normally seen in Ti-6Al-4V
  components, built using wire-fed high-deposition-rate additive manufacturing processes.
  The most important process parameters that control the level of β recrystallization
  – the final grain size and micro-texture – were systematically investigated by simulating
  the deformation and high heating rate conditions in controlled samples, to develop
  the process knowledge required to optimise inter-pass deformation and obtain predictable
  grain sizes. Overall, it was found that the level of β-grain refinement achieved
  by inter-pass deformation was surprisingly insensitive to the ranges of deformation
  temperatures, deformation speeds, and changes to the as-deposited α + β microstructure,
  expected within the WAAM process window, provided a minimum plastic strain of only
  14% was achieved in each added layer. Conversely, the final component grain size
  was shown to be strongly affected by rapid grain growth on re-heating above the
  β transus. The texture results obtained were consistent with previous work which
  suggested that, with fine AM transformation microstructures, new β-grain orientations
  may be produced during the α → β transformation from the development of twinning
  faults, induced by the prior deformation and rapid heating. In contrast, greatly
  increasing the starting α lamellar spacing – to be more similar to that found in
  a wrought material – greatly reduced the level of recrystallization and also appeared
  to change the recrystallization mechanism to favour new β orientations produced
  largely by local lattice rotation.
