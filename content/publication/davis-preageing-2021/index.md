abstract: Certain magnesium alloy systems can obtain superior mechanical strength
  through age hardening. However, conventional ageing heat treatments for these alloys
  are rarely more complex than a single isothermal hold –especially when compared
  to those of aluminium alloys – so age hardenable magnesium alloys may not be achieving
  their full strengthening potential. The use of preageing, where a lower temperature
  heat treatment is utilised before a hotter secondary ageing step, has proven successful
  in boosting the strength of magnesium alloys previously, but these trials are few
  in number, and the testing conditions are limited. In this work, a wide range of
  preageing temperatures and times were trialled on commercial and experimental magnesium
  alloys to determine the effectiveness of the strengthening technique. The results
  showed that preageing can produce a significant boost in hardness, can reduce total
  ageing times, and can provide a degree of mechanical property customisation through
  control of precipitate habit plane and morphology. However, the effectiveness of
  the technique is alloysystem dependent, where the fundamental precipitate nucleation
  and phase evolution is a key contributor to the success of preageing; as is the
  energy barrier to nucleation in an alloy system, whether that be controlled by alloy
  chemistry or thermomechanical processing. The results are discussed in the context
  of alloy design and industrial processing.
