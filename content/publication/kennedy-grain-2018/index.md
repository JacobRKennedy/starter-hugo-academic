abstract: Grain refinement by inoculation relies upon particles which act as heterogeneous
  nucleation sites. A novel concept of grain refinement by isomorphic self-inoculation
  is introduced in this paper. The inoculant particles have the same crystallographic
  structure as the solidifying phase, and the nucleation stage is replaced by direct
  epitaxial growth compared to classical inoculation. This concept has been successfully
  applied to a Ti-Al alloy, where classical inoculants (borides, carbides) can be
  embrittling in the as-cast state. Casting trials were successful in reducing the
  as-cast grain size as well as increasing the equiaxed grain fraction. It is shown
  that, opposed to classical inoculation theory, the particle size distribution has
  no influence and only the number of inoculant particles introduced impacts the final
  grain size. Moreover, the results suggest that each introduced particle can be responsible
  for multiple grains found in the as-cast ingot.
