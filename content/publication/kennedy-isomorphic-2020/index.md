abstract: The potential for using isomorphic inoculation (ISI) to grain refine titanium
  alloys in additive manufacturing was investigated by adding TiAlNb particles to
  Ti-64 during building test samples. A surviving particle was identified and its
  crystallographic relationship with the matrix studied by transmission Kikuchi diffraction.
  The particle and bulk matrix grain were shown to have the same crystallographic
  orientation, demonstrating that the ISI mechanism of solidification bypasses the
  nucleation step in favour of direct epitaxial growth.
