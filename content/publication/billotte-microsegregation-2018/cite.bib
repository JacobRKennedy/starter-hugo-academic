 abstract = {The microsegregation behavior of alloy ﬁller metal 52 (FM 52) was studied using microprobe analysis on two different solidiﬁcation processes. First, microsegregation was characterized in samples manufactured by directional solidiﬁcation, and then by gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). The experimental results were compared with Thermo-Calc calculations to verify their accuracy. It was conﬁrmed that the thermodynamic database predicts most alloying elements well. Once this data had been determined, several tip undercooling calculations were carried out for different solidiﬁcation conditions in terms of ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal gradient values. These calculations allowed the authors to develop a parametrization card for the constants of the microsegregation model, according to the process parameters (e.g., convection in melt pool, thermal gradient, and growth velocity). A new model of microsegregation, including convection and tip undercooling, is also proposed. The Tong–Beckermann microsegregation model was used individually and coupled with a modiﬁed Kurz-Giovanola-Trivedi (KGT) tip undercooling model, in order to take into account the convection in the ﬂuid ﬂow at the dendrite tip. Model predictions were compared to experimental results and showed the microsegregation evolution accurately.},
