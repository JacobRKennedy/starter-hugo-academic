abstract: The microsegregation behavior of alloy ﬁller metal 52 (FM 52) was studied
  using microprobe analysis on two different solidiﬁcation processes. First, microsegregation
  was characterized in samples manufactured by directional solidiﬁcation, and then
  by gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). The experimental results were compared with
  Thermo-Calc calculations to verify their accuracy. It was conﬁrmed that the thermodynamic
  database predicts most alloying elements well. Once this data had been determined,
  several tip undercooling calculations were carried out for different solidiﬁcation
  conditions in terms of ﬂuid ﬂow and thermal gradient values. These calculations
  allowed the authors to develop a parametrization card for the constants of the microsegregation
  model, according to the process parameters (e.g., convection in melt pool, thermal
  gradient, and growth velocity). A new model of microsegregation, including convection
  and tip undercooling, is also proposed. The Tong–Beckermann microsegregation model
  was used individually and coupled with a modiﬁed Kurz-Giovanola-Trivedi (KGT) tip
  undercooling model, in order to take into account the convection in the ﬂuid ﬂow
  at the dendrite tip. Model predictions were compared to experimental results and
  showed the microsegregation evolution accurately.
