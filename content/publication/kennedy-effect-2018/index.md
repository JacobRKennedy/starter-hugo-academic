abstract: The process of isomorphic inoculation relies on precise selection of inoculant
  alloys for a given system. Three alloys, Ti-10Al-25Nb, Ti-25Al-10Ta, and Ti-47Ta
  (at %) were selected as potential isomorphic inoculants for a Ti-46Al alloy. The
  binary Ti-Ta alloy selected was found to be ineffective as an inoculant due to its
  large density difference with the melt, causing the particles to settle. Both ternary
  alloys were successfully implemented as isomorphic inoculants that decreased the
  equiaxed grain size and increased the equiaxed fraction in their ingots. The degree
  of grain refinement obtained was found to be dependent on the number of particles
  introduced to the melt. Also, more new grains were formed than particles added to
  the melt. The grains/particle efficiency varied from greater than one to nearly
  twenty as the size of the particle increased. This is attributed to the breaking
  up of particles into smaller particles by dissolution in the melt. For a given particle
  size, Ti-Al-Ta and Ti-Al-Nb particles were found to have a roughly similar grain/particle
  efficiency.
