abstract: Wire-Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) of large near-net-shape titanium
  parts has the potential to reduce costs in aerospace applications. However, with
  titanium alloys, such as Ti-6Al-4V, conventional WAAM processing conditions generally
  result in epitaxial solidification from the melt pool fusion boundary, which over
  many layers can generate coarse cm-scale,textless001textgreater//ND fibre textured,
  columnar β grain structures within the deposited metal. The mechanical anisotropy
  caused by this coarse primary grain structure cannot be eliminated by subsequent
  solid-state phase transformations. In order to attempt to refine the size of the
  solidified β-grains and reduce their strong texture, the growth restriction efficiency
  of low addition levels of the strongly partitioning element (k = 0.1) yttrium (Y)
  has been investigated. Less than 0.8 wt.% Y was sufficient to reduce the widths
  of the solidified columnar β grains from 1 to 2 mm to 100–300 µm. Y was also found
  to induce a columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) in the latter stages of melt pool
  solidification, which benefits from a lower liquid thermal gradient and higher solidification
  velocity. Inter-dendritic segregation of Y was also found to be significant and
  oxygen scavenging led to the formation of Y2O3 particles in the inter-dendritic
  liquid, with a previously unreported irregular eutectic morphology. High-resolution
  EBSD analysis showed these particles exhibited specific orientation relationships
  with the solidified β grains, which were confirmed experimentally.
