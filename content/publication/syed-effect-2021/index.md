abstract: The influence of three deposition strategies on the fatigue crack growth
  behaviour of Wire + Arc Additive Manufactured (WAAM) Ti–6Al–4V has been investigated
  in the as-built condition. Test samples were prepared using single pass, parallel
  pass, and oscillation deposition strategies and tested with cracks propagating parallel
  and normal to the plane of deposition. Due to the higher local heat input, the oscillation
  build exhibited a significantly coarser columnar β grain structure as well as a
  coarser transformation microstructure, compared to the single pass and parallel
  pass builds, which were very similar. Among the three build methods, the lowest
  crack growth rates were found with the oscillation build. The crack growth data
  was found to broadly fall between that of a recrystallized α (mill-annealed) and
  β annealed wrought material, with the oscillation strategy build behaving more similarly
  to a β annealed microstructure. The fatigue crack growth rate was lower when cracks
  were propagated perpendicular to the build layers. For each build strategy, a greater
  microstructural influence on crack growth rate was found at lower levels of stress
  intensity factor range (textless25 MPa m1/2). However, the anisotropy and scatter
  in the data was much more significant in the case of the oscillation build. These
  differences have been attributed to the stronger α microtexture heterogeneity present
  in the oscillation build, which led to a greater crack deflection and bifurcation,
  giving rise to lower crack growth rates and a higher sensitivity to the anisotropy
  caused by the directional β grain structure.
