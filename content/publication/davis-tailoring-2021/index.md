abstract: High-deposition-rate, directed-energy-deposition additive manufacturing
  (DED-AM) processes typically produce Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64) components with coarse columnar
  β-grain structures that lead to undesirable mechanical anisotropy, as well as a
  fine heterogeneous lamellar transformation microstructure, which is very different
  to that seen standard wrought products. This arises because of the intrinsic lack
  of constitutional undercooling at the solidification front, and the subsequent high
  cooling rates and rapid thermal cycling experienced by the deposited material. In
  this work, the more refined primary β-grain solidification structures and textures
  seen in components built with the novel coaxial electron beam wire DED AM (CEWAM)
  process have been characterised in detail, for the first time, with the aim of investigating
  the potential for this technology to directly replicate the β-annealed damage-tolerant
  microstructure used in large Ti64 aerospace forgings. Due to its different lower
  energy density solidification conditions, it has been confirmed, by electron backscatter
  diffraction (EBSD) analysis and β-grain reconstruction in three orthogonal cross-sections,
  that the CEWAM process changes the melt conditions to promote β-grain nucleation
  ahead of the solidification front, which can result in a highly refined, equiaxed,
  β-grain structure. However, the conditions for refinement were marginal and a mixed
  grain structure was commonly observed in thicker sections. Additionally, the subsequent
  grain-growth stability during β-annealing was investigated. It is shown that an
  equivalent microstructure can be achieved to that seen in a standard β-forged component,
  by grain structure homogenisation and slow cooling through the β transus, to promote
  α colony nucleation, allowing direct part substitution. This was made possible by
  the refined primary β-grain structure achieved during deposition with the CEWAM
  solidification conditions which, importantly, are also shown to lead to a weaker
  texture than in a typical forging.
