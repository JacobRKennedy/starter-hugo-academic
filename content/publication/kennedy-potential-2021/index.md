abstract: Wire-Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) of large near-net-shape titanium
  components has the potential to reduce costs and lead-time in many industrial sectors
  including aerospace. However, with titanium alloys, such as Ti-6Al-4V, standard
  WAAM processing conditions result in solidification microstructures comprising large
  cm-scale, textless001textgreater fibre textured, columnar β grains, which are detrimental
  to mechanical performance. In order to reduce the size of the solidified β-grains,
  as well as refine their columnar morphology and randomise their texture, two cubic
  nitride phases, TiN and ZrN were investigated as potential grain refining inoculants.
  To avoid the cost of manufacturing new wire, experimental trials were performed
  using powder adhered to the surface of the deposited tracks. With TiN particle additions,
  the β grain size was successfully reduced and modified from columnar to equiaxed
  grains, with an average size of 300 µm, while ZrN powder was shown to be ineffective
  at low addition levels studied. Clusters of TiN particles were found to be responsible
  for nucleating multiple β Ti grains. By utilizing the Burgers orientation relationship,
  EBSD investigation showed that a Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship could
  be demonstrated between the refined primary β grains and TiN particles.
