abstract: The potential exists to use ultrasonic shear velocity for real-time microstructure
  assessment of the quenching step in the heat treatment of L80 steel pipe. L80 steel
  samples were austenitised and subsequently cooled in different quench mediums (water,
  oil, heated oil, air and furnace) to produce microstructures ranging from primarily
  martensite to coarse ferrite/pearlite mixed structures. Following heat treatment,
  the samples were ultrasonically tested, tensile and hardness tested and metallographically
  examined. The shear wave velocity was observed to increase as the underlying microstructure
  of each sample changed from primarily martensite, to primarily bainite and finally
  to coarse ferrite + pearlite. The measured shear wave velocity exhibited an inverse
  linear dependence on both yield strength and microhardness.
